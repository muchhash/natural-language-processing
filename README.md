# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Specialization
This GitHub repository contains materials and programming assignments for **Natural Language Processing Specialization** by deeplearning.ai, which can be accessed at www.coursera.org/specializations/natural-language-processing.

In the **Natural Language Processing Specialization**, you will learn how to design NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, create tools to translate languages, summarize text, and even build chatbots. These and other NLP applications will be at the forefront of the coming transformation to an AI-powered future.

## Learning Scope
* Use logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and word vectors to implement sentiment analysis, complete analogies, translate words, and use locality-sensitive hashing to approximate nearest neighbors.
* Use dynamic programming, hidden Markov models, and word embeddings to autocorrect misspelled words, autocomplete partial sentences, and identify part-of-speech tags for words.
* Use dense and recurrent neural networks, LSTMs, GRUs, and Siamese networks in TensorFlow and Trax to perform advanced sentiment analysis, text generation, named entity recognition, and to identify duplicate questions.
* Use encoder-decoder, causal, and self-attention to perform advanced machine translation of complete sentences, text summarization, question-answering, and build chatbots. Models covered include T5, BERT, transformer, reformer, and etc.
